Feature: merging a branch that was deleted at the remote

  Background:
    Given a Git repo with origin
    And the branches
      | NAME  | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | alpha | feature | main   | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE      | FILE NAME  | FILE CONTENT  |
      | alpha  | local, origin | alpha commit | alpha-file | alpha content |
    And the branches
      | NAME | TYPE    | PARENT | LOCATIONS     |
      | beta | feature | alpha  | local, origin |
    And the commits
      | BRANCH | LOCATION      | MESSAGE     | FILE NAME | FILE CONTENT |
      | beta   | local, origin | beta commit | beta-file | beta content |
    And the current branch is "beta"
    And origin deletes the "beta" branch
    When I run "git-town merge"

  Scenario: result
    Then Git Town runs the commands
      | BRANCH | COMMAND                  |
      | beta   | git fetch --prune --tags |
    And Git Town prints the error:
      """
      branch "beta" is not in sync with its tracking branch, please run "git town sync" and try again
      """
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial branches and lineage exist now

  Scenario: undo
    When I run "git-town undo"
    Then Git Town runs no commands
    And Git Town prints:
      """
      nothing to undo
      """
    And the initial commits exist now
    And the initial lineage exists now
